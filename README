to compile type:
	make

run with:
	./protspam [options] -l <filelist>

<filelist>:
	A plain text file, specifying the relative path to each input dataset.
	To create the "filelist" simply run:

		I.	"ls ./path/to/input/* > filelist"		## assuming all your proteome files (*.fasta, *.faa, etc.) are stored in the "input"-folder.
					or
		II.	"ls *.fna > filelist"								## assuming all your proteome files are stored in the current directory and they end with an *.fna extension.

	Note:

		Which file extensions the input files have does not matter as long as the "filelist" contains the correct path to the file.

		Method I:
			The asterix (*) after the containing folder is mandatory, so that "ls" will return the relative filepaths instead of just the filenames.
			"protspam" has to be called from the folder containing the "filelist".

		Method II:
			Since this command does just output the filenames...
			 	a) the "filelist" has to be in the same folder
				b) "protspam" has to be called from the very same folder			


<sequence> format:
	Sequence must be in FASTA format. All protein sequences of one proteome must be contained in one FASTA file. Example:

>Protein1
RAKSDLKEASDKE..
>Protein2
ATSDLAGTASDKE..
>Protein3
ARNCQEFGSDSDW..
..

etc.

Options:
	-h/-?: print this help and exit
	-w <integer>: pattern weight (default 8)
	-d <integer>: number of don't-care positions (default 40)
	-s <integer>: the minimum score of a spaced-word match to be considered homologous (default: 0)
	-p <integer>: number of patterns used (default 1)
	-t <integer>: number of threads (default: omp_get_max_threads() )
	-o <integer>: filename for distance matrix (default: DMat)
	-l <filename>: specify a list of files to read as input (one inputfile per organism containing each sequence, seperated by headers)

Paper Abstract:

Word-based or "alignment-free" sequence comparison has become an active area of research in bioinformatics.
Recently, fast word-based algorithms have been proposed that are able to accurately estimate phylogenetic
distances between genomic DNA sequences without the need to calculate full sequence alignments. One of these
approaches is Filtered Spaced Word Matches. Herein, we extend this approach to estimate evolutionary distances
between species based on their complete or incomplete proteomes; our implementation is called Prot-SpaM.
We show that Prot-SpaM can accurately estimate phylogenetic distances, and that our program can be used to
calculate phylogenetic trees from whole proteomes in a matter of seconds.
For various groups of taxa, we show that trees calculated with Prot-SpaM are of high quality.
